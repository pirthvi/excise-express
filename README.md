### Setup
- Simply clone the repo
```git clone https://github.com/Parasin/bare-express.git```

- Install the dependencies 
   - Install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
   - Install application dependencies ```npm install```

- Add the routes you need under the `routes` directory, and include require them in your `routes/index.js` file.
```
| routes/
| index.js
|
|---> user/
     |---> index.js
|
|---> auth/
     |---> index.js
```

```
//FILE: routes/index.js
const user = require( './user' );

// WON'T ENFORCE HTTPS
  if ( config.env === 'development' ) {
     app.use( '/user', user );
  }

  // WILL ENFORCE HTTPS
  else {
     app.use( '/user', user );
  }
```
